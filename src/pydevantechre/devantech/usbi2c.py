        I/O mode and I2C mode cannot be mixed, I/O commands should 
        not be used when I2C devices are connected. 
        
        If the USB-I2C module is not being used for I2C, it can be 
        used as general purpose I/O controller with three I/O lines. 
        Input 1 is always an input only pin and has a 47k pull-up 
        resistor (not 4.7k like the others). The other two can be input 
        or output. The outputs are set high/low with the SETPINS command. 
        The pin is not actively driven high, it is released and pulled 
        high by a 4.7k resistor. Output low is actively driven and can 
        sink a maximum of 24mA. GETPINS will return the status of the 
        I/O pins. To use an I/O pin as an input, it must first have 
        a 1 (high) written to it. This will release the pin so that 
        the 4.7k resistor will pull it high, it can then be used as 
        an input. Both SETPINS and GETPINS commands will return the 
        status of the I/O Pins, however, only SETPINS can change them.

        Parameters
        ----------
        io3 : bool

        This command is provided for CM02 compatibility. It assumes

        and a number of SRF08 rangefinders (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 or 16).
        After sending the new motor speeds to the MD22, the USB-I2C 
        will send a return frame comprising the battery voltage 
        (reads 0x00). This is followed by two bytes of compass 
        bearing - high byte first, and then three bytes for each SRF08. 
        The first of the three bytes is the SRF08's light sensor reading. 
        The next two bytes is the range - high byte first. 

        SRF08 data is always returned starting with address 0xE0, 0xE2, 
        0xE4 - going up one address at a time until all requested SRF08's 
        data has been sent.

        After sending the data back up to the PC, the USB-I2C automatically 
        issues a new ranging command to all SRF08s. The ranging 
        command used is 82 (0x52) which returns the results in uS. 
        To convert to cm divide by 58 and to convert to inches 
        divide by 148.

        SRF08 addresses should have been set up before running this 
        command and the MD22 should be initialized to the mode and 
        acceleration required. One more important feature. The SCAN 
        command also sets up a 500mS timer on the USB-I2C. If another 
        SCAN command is not received within this time, a command is 
        automatically sent to the MD22 to stop the motors. This is to
