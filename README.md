# Welcome to Robosoc's eurobot repo.
This is where all our code will be kept. The code that will run on the robots will be on the master branch.

# Getting started for new members
If you've never used Git or Github, Git is a software some body wrote that helps software developers manage their code.
* Git allows you to make branches of your code, to add/test new features, if they work you can merge it to the original one for production. In lay man's terms it means that if you want to write code to move the robotic arm but scared that you might mess with the code that already exists, Git will allows you to essentially make a copy for yourself to experiment. If you fail, the original code will still be there, If it works we can add your change to the original or 'master branch'.
* Github is the site that we will use to store our code and review our code.

# Where to start
* Create a Github account (Oh wait you already have otherwise you will not be readind this xD)
* Install [git bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
* Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button above. This will give you your own copy of the repository that you can experiment/add code to.
* Open git-bash in a folder of your choice where you want to keep the code. On windows you can right click in any folder and 'Git Bash here'. On Mac/Linux you need to use cd and ls commands to navigate to the folder you want. Once in that folder, do
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/your_git_username/robosoc_eurobot_2017.git
```
